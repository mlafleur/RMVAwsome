This code is part of a tutorial and presentation series on Windows Modern UI and Windows Phone development. It is also a working application available on each platforms Store. 

Notes
===
- Each tutorial has an orphaned branch named "tut<id>"
- The "prod" branch is the branch published to the store
- The "dev" branch holds active development and may or may not be working
- If you are planning to fork, I recommend using the prod as it is typically the most stable
